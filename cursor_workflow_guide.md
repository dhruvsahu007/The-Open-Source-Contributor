# Cursor AI Workflow Guide for Open Source Contribution

## Leveraging Cursor's AI Features

### 1. Codebase Ingestion and Understanding

#### Initial Setup:
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Open in Cursor**: 
   - Open the project folder in Cursor
   - Allow Cursor to index the entire codebase
   - This enables AI features like @ referencing and repo-wide chat

#### Understanding the Architecture:
- **Use @ Referencing**: Type `@` followed by function/class names to understand relationships
- **Repo-wide Chat**: Ask questions about the entire codebase
- **File Navigation**: Use AI to find relevant files and understand their purpose

### 2. AI-Powered Code Analysis

#### Understanding Existing Code:
```
@function_name - Find and understand specific functions
@class_name - Explore class definitions and methods
@file_name - Understand file structure and purpose
```

#### Example Queries for Cursor:
- "What is the main entry point of this application?"
- "How does the authentication system work?"
- "Where are the tests located and how are they structured?"
- "What's the purpose of this specific function?"
- "How does this module interact with other parts of the codebase?"

#### Real Example from SmartTaskTracker:
```
"What is the main entry point of this application?"
→ AI Response: "The main entry point is server/index.ts which sets up Express server and registers routes"

"How does the OpenAI integration work?"
→ AI Response: "The OpenAI integration is in server/openai.ts and uses GPT-4o to parse natural language tasks"

"What's the database schema structure?"
→ AI Response: "The schema is defined in shared/schema.ts using Drizzle ORM with a tasks table"
```

### 3. Issue Analysis with AI

#### Before Starting Work:
1. **Read the Issue**: Understand the problem description
2. **Use AI to Analyze**: Ask Cursor about the affected code
3. **Identify Scope**: Use AI to understand what needs to be changed
4. **Plan Approach**: Get AI suggestions for implementation

#### Example Analysis Queries:
- "What files are involved in this bug?"
- "How does the current implementation work?"
- "What would be the best approach to fix this issue?"
- "Are there any tests I should be aware of?"

#### Real Example from SmartTaskTracker:
```
"I want to add task categories. What files would need to be modified?"
→ AI Response: "You'd need to modify shared/schema.ts for database schema, server/routes.ts for API, and frontend components for UI"

"How does the current task creation work?"
→ AI Response: "Tasks are created via POST /api/tasks/parse which uses OpenAI to parse natural language, then creates task in database"
```

### 4. Code Generation and Style Matching

#### Maintaining Project Style:
- **Ask Cursor**: "What's the coding style used in this project?"
- **Pattern Matching**: "Show me examples of similar functions in this codebase"
- **Style Consistency**: "How should I format this code to match the project?"

#### Code Generation Examples:
```
"Generate a function that follows the same pattern as the existing ones"
"Create a test for this function following the project's testing conventions"
"Write documentation for this feature in the project's style"
```

#### Real Example from SmartTaskTracker:
```
"Generate a CategorySelector component that matches the project's style"
→ AI generated a complete component with proper TypeScript types and Tailwind styling

"Update the schema to include a category field"
→ AI suggested the exact schema modification with proper Drizzle ORM syntax
```

### 5. Debugging with AI Assistance

#### When You Encounter Issues:
1. **Error Analysis**: Paste error messages and ask for explanations
2. **Code Review**: Ask AI to review your changes for potential issues
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Get suggestions for different approaches
4. **Testing Help**: Ask for help writing tests or debugging test failures

#### Debugging Queries:
- "What could be causing this error?"
- "How can I debug this issue?"
- "What's the best way to test this change?"
- "Are there any edge cases I should consider?"

### 6. Documentation and Comments

#### Using AI for Documentation:
- **Code Comments**: "Add comments to explain this function"
- **README Updates**: "Help me update the README for this new feature"
- **API Documentation**: "Generate documentation for this API endpoint"
- **Change Log**: "Help me write a clear commit message"

#### Real Example from SmartTaskTracker:
```
"Generate comprehensive documentation for the task categories feature"
→ AI created a detailed CONTRIBUTION_README.md with technical implementation, usage examples, and testing guidelines
```

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### AI-Assisted Testing:
- **Test Generation**: "Generate tests for this function"
- **Coverage Analysis**: "What test cases am I missing?"
- **Integration Testing**: "How should I test this integration?"
- **Performance Testing**: "What performance considerations should I test?"

### 8. Pull Request Preparation

#### Using AI for PR Quality:
1. **Code Review**: Ask AI to review your changes
2. **Description Writing**: "Help me write a clear PR description"
3. **Change Summary**: "Summarize the changes I made"
4. **Testing Checklist**: "What should I test before submitting?"

#### Real Example from SmartTaskTracker:
```
"Help me write a commit message for the task categories feature"
→ AI suggested: "feat: Add comprehensive task categories feature with AI detection and filtering"
```

### 9. Advanced Cursor Features

#### Repository-wide Search:
- **Semantic Search**: Find code by functionality, not just text
- **Cross-file References**: Understand how different files interact
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand project dependencies

#### Code Refactoring:
- **AI-Suggested Refactoring**: Get suggestions for improving code
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns and suggest improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Get suggestions for better performance

### 10. Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

#### Do's:
- ✅ Use AI to understand unfamiliar code patterns
- ✅ Ask for explanations of complex logic
- ✅ Use AI to generate tests and documentation
- ✅ Leverage AI for code review and quality checks
- ✅ Ask for alternative approaches when stuck

#### Don'ts:
- ❌ Don't blindly copy AI-generated code without understanding it
- ❌ Don't rely solely on AI without learning the codebase

### 11. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### When AI Doesn't Understand:
- **Provide More Context**: Include relevant code snippets
- **Be Specific**: Ask targeted questions instead of vague ones
- **Use Examples**: Show examples of what you're trying to achieve
- **Break Down Problems**: Ask about smaller parts of the problem

#### When Code Doesn't Work:
- **Error Analysis**: Ask AI to explain error messages
- **Step-by-Step Debugging**: Break down the problem into smaller parts
- **Alternative Approaches**: Ask for different solutions
- **Community Resources**: Use AI to find relevant documentation or examples

### 12. Continuous Learning
