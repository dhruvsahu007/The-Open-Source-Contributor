# Open Source Project Selection Guide

## Finding the Right Project

### 1. GitHub Search Strategies

#### Search Queries to Try:
```
language:python is:issue is:open label:"good first issue"
language:javascript is:issue is:open label:"help wanted"

stars:>100 language:python is:issue is:open label:"good first issue"
```

#### Advanced Search Filters:
- **Language**: Filter by your preferred programming language
- **Stars**: Look for projects with 100+ stars (indicates community interest)
- **Last Updated**: Choose projects updated within the last 3 months
- **Issues**: Look for projects with open issues and responsive maintainers

### 2. Project Evaluation Criteria
