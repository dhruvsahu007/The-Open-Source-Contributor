# The Open Source Contributor

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of contributing to open source repositories using AI tools like Cursor. The goal is to navigate, understand, and contribute to a real-world, unfamiliar codebase effectively.

## Objectives

- Find and analyze an open-source project on GitHub
- Use Cursor's AI features to understand project architecture
- Identify and fix bugs or add enhancements
- Submit Pull Requests to the chosen repository
- Document the entire process

## Methodology

### 1. Project Selection Criteria
- **Language/Framework**: Choose a project in a language/framework you're comfortable with
- **Activity Level**: Look for actively maintained projects with recent commits
- **Issue Availability**: Projects with "good first issue" or "bug" labels
- **Community**: Projects with responsive maintainers and clear contribution guidelines

### 2. Analysis Process
- **Codebase Ingestion**: Use Cursor to ingest the entire repository
- **Architecture Understanding**: Utilize @ referencing and repo-wide chat features
- **Module Identification**: Identify key components and their relationships
- **Issue Analysis**: Understand the problem before implementing solutions

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **Style Matching**: Use Cursor to match existing code style and conventions
- **Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation if needed
- **Communication**: Follow the project's contribution guidelines
