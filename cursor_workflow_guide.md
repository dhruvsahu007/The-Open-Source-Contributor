# Cursor AI Workflow Guide for Open Source Contribution

## Leveraging Cursor's AI Features

### 1. Codebase Ingestion and Understanding

#### Initial Setup:
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Open in Cursor**: 
   - Open the project folder in Cursor
   - Allow Cursor to index the entire codebase
   - This enables AI features like @ referencing and repo-wide chat

#### Understanding the Architecture:
- **Use @ Referencing**: Type `@` followed by function/class names to understand relationships
- **Repo-wide Chat**: Ask questions about the entire codebase
- **File Navigation**: Use AI to find relevant files and understand their purpose

### 2. AI-Powered Code Analysis

#### Understanding Existing Code:
```
@function_name - Find and understand specific functions
@class_name - Explore class definitions and methods
@file_name - Understand file structure and purpose
```

#### Example Queries for Cursor:
- "What is the main entry point of this application?"
- "How does the authentication system work?"
- "Where are the tests located and how are they structured?"
- "What's the purpose of this specific function?"
- "How does this module interact with other parts of the codebase?"

### 3. Issue Analysis with AI

#### Before Starting Work:
1. **Read the Issue**: Understand the problem description
2. **Use AI to Analyze**: Ask Cursor about the affected code
3. **Identify Scope**: Use AI to understand what needs to be changed
4. **Plan Approach**: Get AI suggestions for implementation

#### Example Analysis Queries:
- "What files are involved in this bug?"
- "How does the current implementation work?"
- " What would be the best approach to fix this issue?"
- "Are there any tests I should be aware of?"

### 4. Code Generation and Style Matching

#### Maintaining Project Style:
- **Ask Cursor**: "What's the coding style used in this project?"
- **Pattern Matching**: "Show me examples of similar functions in this codebase"
- **Style Consistency**: "How should I format this code to match the project?"

#### Code Generation Examples:
```
"Generate a function that follows the same pattern as the existing ones"
"Create a test for this function following the project's testing conventions"
"Write documentation for this feature in the project's style"
```

### 5. Debugging with AI Assistance

#### When You Encounter Issues:
1. **Error Analysis**: Paste error messages and ask for explanations
2. **Code Review**: Ask AI to review your changes for potential issues
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Get suggestions for different approaches
4. **Testing Help**: Ask for help writing tests or debugging test failures

#### Debugging Queries:
- "What could be causing this error?"
- "How can I debug this issue?"
- "What's the best way to test this change?"
- "Are there any edge cases I should consider?"

### 6. Documentation and Comments

#### Using AI for Documentation:
- **Code Comments**: "Add comments to explain this function"
- **README Updates**: "Help me update the README for this new feature"
- **API Documentation**: "Generate documentation for this API endpoint"
- **Change Log**: "Help me write a clear commit message"

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### AI-Assisted Testing:
- **Test Generation**: "Generate tests for this function"
- **Coverage Analysis**: "What test cases am I missing?"
- **Integration Testing**: "How should I test this integration?"
- **Performance Testing**: "What performance considerations should I test?"

### 8. Pull Request Preparation

#### Using AI for PR Quality:
1. **Code Review**: Ask AI to review your changes
2. **Description Writing**: "Help me write a clear PR description"
3. **Change Summary**: "Summarize the changes I made"
4. **Testing Checklist**: "What should I test before submitting?"

### 9. Advanced Cursor Features

#### Repository-wide Search:
- **Semantic Search**: Find code by functionality, not just text
- **Cross-file References**: Understand how different files interact
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand project dependencies

#### Code Refactoring:
- **AI-Suggested Refactoring**: Get suggestions for improving code
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns and suggest improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Get suggestions for better performance

### 10. Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

#### Do's:
- ✅ Use AI to understand unfamiliar code patterns
- ✅ Ask for explanations of complex logic
- ✅ Use AI to generate tests and documentation
- ✅ Leverage AI for code review and quality checks
- ✅ Ask for alternative approaches when stuck

#### Don'ts:
- ❌ Don't blindly copy AI-generated code without understanding it
- ❌ Don't rely solely on AI without learning the codebase
- ❌ Don't ignore project-specific conventions and patterns
- ❌ Don't submit code without testing it thoroughly

### 11. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### When AI Doesn't Understand:
- **Provide More Context**: Include relevant code snippets
- **Be Specific**: Ask targeted questions instead of vague ones
- **Use Examples**: Show examples of what you're trying to achieve
- **Break Down Problems**: Ask about smaller parts of the problem

#### When Code Doesn't Work:
- **Error Analysis**: Ask AI to explain error messages
- **Step-by-Step Debugging**: Break down the problem into smaller parts
- **Alternative Approaches**: Ask for different solutions
- **Community Resources**: Use AI to find relevant documentation or examples

### 12. Continuous Learning

#### Improving AI Usage:
- **Learn from Interactions**: Pay attention to what works well
- **Experiment**: Try different ways of asking questions
- **Combine with Manual Research**: Use AI alongside traditional debugging
- **Share Knowledge**: Document effective AI prompts for future use

### 13. Example Workflow

#### Complete Example for a Bug Fix:

1. **Issue Analysis**:
   ```
   "I need to fix issue #123. Can you help me understand what's happening?"
   ```

2. **Code Understanding**:
   ```
   "@function_name - What does this function do and how does it relate to the bug?"
   ```

3. **Solution Planning**:
   ```
   "What would be the best approach to fix this issue?"
   ```

4. **Implementation**:
   ```
   "Generate code that fixes this issue following the project's style"
   ```

5. **Testing**:
   ```
   "Generate tests for this fix"
   ```

6. **Documentation**:
   ```
   "Help me write a commit message and PR description"
   ```
