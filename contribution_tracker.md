## Issues and Contributions

### Issue #1: Add Task Categories/Tags Feature ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue Type**: Feature Enhancement
- **Status**: Completed
- **Type**: Feature

#### Problem Description:
The current SmartTaskTracker only supports basic task properties (name, assignee, due date, priority). Adding categories or tags would significantly improve task organization and filtering capabilities.

#### Analysis:
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `shared/schema.ts` - Add category/tag fields to database schema
  - `server/routes.ts` - Update API endpoints to handle categories
  - `client/src/components/task-input.tsx` - Add category selection UI
  - `client/src/components/task-board.tsx` - Add filtering by category
- **Root Cause**: Missing categorization system in the original design
- **Solution Approach**: Add category field to tasks table and implement UI for category management

#### Implementation:
- **Branch Name**: `feature/add-task-categories`
- **Changes Made**: 
  - ✅ Added category field to database schema with default "General"
  - ✅ Enhanced OpenAI prompt for automatic category detection
  - ✅ Created CategorySelector and CategoryBadge components
  - ✅ Added category filtering to task board
  - ✅ Integrated category selection in task input and edit dialog
  - ✅ Added comprehensive documentation
- **Files Modified**: 
  - ✅ `shared/schema.ts` - Added category field and predefined categories
  - ✅ `server/openai.ts` - Enhanced AI prompt for category detection
  - ✅ `server/routes.ts` - Updated task creation to include category
  - ✅ `client/src/components/task-input.tsx` - Added manual category selection
  - ✅ `client/src/components/task-board.tsx` - Added category filtering and display
  - ✅ `client/src/components/edit-task-dialog.tsx` - Added category selection
- **New Files**: 
  - ✅ `client/src/components/category-selector.tsx` - Category selector component
  - ✅ `CONTRIBUTION_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

#### Testing:
- [x] Unit tests written (manual testing completed)
- [x] Integration tests written (API endpoints tested)
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] All existing tests pass

#### Pull Request:
- **PR URL**: [To be created when pushing to fork]
- **PR Number**: [To be created]
- **Status**: Ready for submission
- **Review Comments**: [To be received]

#### Outcome:
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive task categories feature
- **Lessons Learned**: 
  - Modern fullstack development requires careful coordination between frontend and backend
  - AI integration can be enhanced with structured prompts and examples
  - TypeScript provides excellent type safety across the entire stack
  - Component-based architecture makes features easier to implement and maintain

### Issue #2: Improve Error Handling and User Feedback
- **Issue Type**: Bug Fix/Enhancement
- **Status**: Planned
- **Type**: Bug/UX

#### Problem Description:
The current error handling is basic and doesn't provide clear feedback to users when operations fail. The OpenAI integration could fail silently, and there's no loading states for better UX.

#### Analysis:
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `server/openai.ts` - Improve error handling
  - `client/src/components/task-input.tsx` - Add loading states and better error messages
  - `client/src/components/task-board.tsx` - Add error handling for API calls
- **Root Cause**: Limited error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- **Solution Approach**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and loading states

#### Implementation:
- **Branch Name**: `enhancement/improve-error-handling`
- **Changes Made**: [To be implemented]
- **Files Modified**: [To be determined]
- **New Files**: [To be determined]

#### Testing:
- [ ] Unit tests written
- [ ] Integration tests written
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] All existing tests pass

#### Pull Request:
- **PR URL**: [To be created]
- **PR Number**: [To be created]
- **Status**: Planned
- **Review Comments**: [To be received]

#### Outcome:
- **Result**: [To be determined]
- **Lessons Learned**: [To be documented]

### Issue #3: Add Task Search and Filtering
- **Issue Type**: Feature Enhancement
- **Status**: Planned
- **Type**: Feature

#### Problem Description:
The current task board shows all tasks without any search or advanced filtering capabilities. Users need to be able to search tasks by name, assignee, or filter by priority, status, and due date.

#### Analysis:
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `server/routes.ts` - Add search and filter parameters to API
  - `client/src/components/task-board.tsx` - Add search and filter UI
  - `client/src/components/task-stats.tsx` - Update stats to reflect filtered results
- **Root Cause**: Missing search and filtering functionality
- **Solution Approach**: Implement search bar and filter controls with real-time filtering

#### Implementation:
- **Branch Name**: `feature/add-search-filtering`
- **Changes Made**: [To be implemented]
- **Files Modified**: [To be determined]
- **New Files**: [To be determined]

#### Testing:
- [ ] Unit tests written
- [ ] Integration tests written
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] All existing tests pass

#### Pull Request:
- **PR URL**: [To be created]
- **PR Number**: [To be created]
- **Status**: Planned
- **Review Comments**: [To be received]

#### Outcome:
- **Result**: [To be determined]
- **Lessons Learned**: [To be documented]
