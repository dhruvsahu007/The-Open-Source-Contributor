# Quick Start Guide: Open Source Contribution

## üöÄ Get Started in 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Find Your First Project (10 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub** and search for projects with good first issues:
   ```
   language:python is:issue is:open label:"good first issue"
   language:javascript is:issue is:open label:"help wanted"
   ```

2. **Pick a project** that:
   - Has recent activity (commits in last month)
   - Uses a language you know
   - Has clear documentation
   - Has responsive maintainers

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment (10 minutes)

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```
3. **Open in Cursor** and let it index the codebase
4. **Install dependencies** and run the project locally

### Step 3: Choose Your First Issue (10 minutes)

1. **Browse open issues** in the repository
2. **Look for labels** like:
   - `good first issue`
   - `help wanted`
   - `bug`
   - `documentation`
3. **Pick an issue** that:
   - Is clearly described
   - Is within your skill level
   - Hasn't been assigned to someone else

## üéØ Recommended First Contributions

### For Beginners:
- **Documentation fixes**: Typos, broken links, unclear instructions
- **Simple bug fixes**: Well-defined, small scope issues
- **Test additions**: Adding missing tests for existing features
- **UI improvements**: Small frontend fixes or accessibility improvements

### For Intermediate Developers:
- **Feature additions**: Small new features or enhancements
- **Performance improvements**: Optimizing existing code
- **Refactoring**: Code cleanup and improvements
- **Integration work**: Adding new integrations or APIs

## üîß Essential Tools Setup

### Required Tools:
- **Git**: Version control
- **Cursor**: AI-powered code editor
- **GitHub Account**: For repository access
- **Language-specific tools**: (Python, Node.js, etc.)

### Optional but Recommended:
- **GitHub CLI**: Command-line GitHub interface
- **VS Code Extensions**: If not using Cursor
- **Docker**: For containerized development environments
